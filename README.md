# Visual-categories-in-dogs-and-humans
Some of the code related to my upcoming paper in which we compare the visual cortex of humans and dogs using fMRI.

We collected data from 15 family dogs of different breeds and 13 humans. All procedures involving dogs met national and international guidelines for animal care and were approved by the National Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee. All procedures involving humans were approved by the appropriate ethics committee.

In this project I collected short videos from youtube (available under a Creative Commons License). The videos displayed various situations and backgrounds using natural colors to maximize ecological validity.
